This repository holds the code for the mySmartGrid project and is split into following subsections:
- web/drupal: theme and modules that turn a stock Drupal installation into www.mysmartgrid.de
- web/api: our Erlang/Webmachine-based JSON/REST code for api.mysmartgrid.de
- openwrt: contains openwrt packages/patches/make menuconfig to tweak a stock openwrt kamikaze build into a Fluksometer
- uc: the microcontroller code that is loaded onto the sensor board's AVR.

Enjoy!
the mySmartGrid team
